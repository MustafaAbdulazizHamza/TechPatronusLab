# Tech Patronus Lab

I am Mustafa Abdulaziz, a Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing Engineer with a strong interest in Networking, Network Security, Cybersecurity AI, and Intrusion Detection. This personal website is designed to showcase my work and achievements throughout my academic journey.

I am proficient in both Python and Golang, which I use extensively for my development work. The website is organized into three main sections:

1. **Presentations:** A curated selection of presentations I have delivered during my studies, both at university and online.
2. **Tools:** A collection of simple scripts and utilities I have created for learning purposes or specific tasks.
3. **Projects:** An overview of my larger and more comprehensive projects.
